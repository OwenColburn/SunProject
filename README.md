# SunProject
This repository contains all the code files, including .tex, .py, and .nb that are required for a Raspberry Pi Sun Project.
This project collects data for the sun's position throughout the day in 15-minute intervals, and exports that data to a spreadsheet
in the project folder. 
Every 15 minutes, the sheet is parsed, and a servo rotates to the Sun's position, and the LCD is updated with the angle.
